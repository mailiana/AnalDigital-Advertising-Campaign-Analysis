# Digital-Advertising-Campaign-Analysis
This project analyzes digital ad campaigns to identify top performers by examining revenue, cost, and ROI. Insights guide data-driven decisions, optimizing ad spend, boosting impact, and maximizing budget efficiency.
# Abstract

This project evaluates the performance of various digital advertising campaigns to identify the
most effective strategies for a digital marketing department. By examining key metrics like
revenue, cost, and return on investment (ROI), we uncover insights into which campaigns yield
the highest returns. This analysis provides actionable recommendations to optimize advertising
spending and improve overall campaign effectiveness. The findings will help the digital marketing
team make data-driven decisions to maximize their marketing impact and budget efficiency.

# Introduction

In the current digital marketing landscape, understanding campaign effectiveness is crucial for
strategic budget allocation and maximizing return on investment (ROI). The digital marketing
department faces the challenge of determining which of their advertising campaigns deliver the
best outcomes. With multiple campaigns running across different channels and formats, it is
often difficult to assess which ads drive the most revenue and engagement. Ineffective
budgeting can lead to missed opportunities or over-investment in underperforming campaigns.
This project aims to address these challenges by analyzing a dataset of digital advertising
campaigns. The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
1. Identify campaigns with the highest and lowest revenue.
2. Determine if there is a correlation between advertising costs and revenue.
3. Identify campaigns with the highest ROI.
By addressing these questions, we aim to provide insights that will allow the digital marketing
department to make data-driven decisions to optimize future campaigns and budget
allocations.

# Methodology

Data Sources
The dataset used in this analysis contains detailed information on multiple digital advertising
campaigns, including metrics that track performance over several months. Key data columns
include:
• Date Details: Month and day of each ad campaign.
• Campaign ID: Unique identifier for each campaign.
• User Engagement: Engagement level metric (e.g., High, Low).
• Banner Dimensions: Specifies the banner size used.
• Placement: Location of the ad placement
Displays: Total ad impressions.
• Cost: Advertising spend per ad.
• Clicks: Number of ad clicks.
• Revenue: Revenue generated by each ad.
• Post-Click Conversions: Number of conversions following ad clicks.
• Post-Click Sales Amount: Sales amount following clicks

Tools
Microsoft Excel was used for all aspects of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Excel’s
functions, such as pivot tables, charts, and formulas, facilitated comprehensive analysis of
campaign performance.
Methods
1. Data Cleaning:
o Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values.
o Ensured consistency in data formats, especially for date columns.
o Calculated a new column for profit to assess ROI.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o Descriptive Statistics: Calculated metrics such as mean, median, minimum,
and maximum for key variables (e.g., revenue, cost, clicks).
o Campaign Performance Summary: Used pivot tables to summarize and
compare campaign revenue, cost, and clicks.
o Correlation Analysis: Created scatter plots to explore the relationship between
cost and revenue.
3.Data Visualization:
o Bar Charts: Visualized total revenue, cost, and profit for each campaign.
o Line Graphs: Tracked campaign performance over time.
o Dashboard: Developed an interactive dashboard displaying key metrics
(revenue, cost, ROI) for a clear overview.

# Results
Key Findings
1. Revenue Performance: Campaign 1generated the highest revenue and Campaign 3 had
the lowest. Campaign 1 had the highest profit return.
2. Cost and Revenue Correlation: A moderate positive correlation was observed between cost and revenue, indicating that higher spending generally led to higher returns,
although not uniformly across all campaigns.
3. Return on Investment (ROI): Campaign 1 had the highest ROI, demonstrating costeffectiveness, while Campaign 3 had the lowest ROI, suggesting it was not as profitable
despite its cost.
